🧑‍🤝‍🧑👩‍💼👨‍💼
In today's competitive job market, employee turnover presents a significant challenge for organizations. High attrition rates result in increased recruitment and training costs, disrupt team dynamics, and negatively impact overall productivity. Understanding the key factors contributing to employee attrition is crucial for organizations to take proactive measures in retaining top talent and reducing unnecessary turnover.

Organizations must identify the primary factors that influence employee attrition and assess whether predictive models can accurately forecast which employees are at risk of leaving within the next six months. Key considerations include the impact of salary, compensation, and benefits on attrition, the role of employee tenure in turnover likelihood, and whether gender or age disparities exist in attrition rates. Additionally, understanding the influence of work-life balance and the correlation between business travel frequency and employee retention is essential.

This study relies on a dataset comprising various employee attributes, including demographics, job-related factors, and attrition status. The dataset provides insights into attrition trends and supports the development of predictive models. Demographic factors such as age, gender, marital status, and education background contribute to understanding workforce composition. Compensation and benefits data, including monthly income, hourly rate, daily rate, stock option levels, and salary hikes, help assess financial incentives for retention. Job-related factors, including job level, job role, years at the company, and tenure with the current manager, offer insights into career progression and stability. Work environment and satisfaction metrics, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and relationship satisfaction, reflect employee well-being. Workload and performance indicators, including business travel frequency, overtime, and performance ratings, highlight potential stressors influencing attrition.
